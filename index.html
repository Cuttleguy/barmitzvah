            <div class="card-body">
                A Bar/Bat/Bnei Mitzvah is a child in the Jewish religion who reaches the age of "Jewish adulthood." This occurs at 13 years old, and at this time the child in question reads from the Torah (which contains the first five books of the hebrew bible) for the first time. However, the term commonly refers to the ceremony in which we celebrate said child becoming Bar Mitzvah

                My parents have informed me that the dress code is "smart casual." Some people will be in khakis and a polo shirt or blouse, while others will wear suits and dresses. No jeans, shorts or sweatpants.

            <div class="card-header">What is Proper Behavior During the Service?</div>
            <div class="card-body">
                <p>During sevices, people remain quiet out of respect for the service, and are encouraged to participate in as much or as little of the service as they choose. Cellphones should be silenced and kept away. (The service will be streamed live and recorded, should there be a section you would like to watch later.) At various points throughout the service, attendees will be asked to stand if they are able. Standing is done out of respect for what is taking place and does not signify agreement with the prayer(s).</p>
                <p>The Torah will be brought through the aisles of the congregation. You may see people move from their seats out to the aisles during the "Torah procession" when the Torah is brought out among the people. You will see some people kiss the corner of their tallit or prayer book, and touch the Torah as it passes. This is a sign of respect and love for the Torah, and shows the happiness and joy that is felt in having received it. You may participate in this custom as you wish, but it is not necessary. It is a matter of personal comfort.

            <div class="card-header">Besides Proper Behavior, What Other Customs and Ettiquettes Should I Expect?</div>
            <div class="card-body">
                <p><b>Shabbat Shalom:</b> You may hear people greeting each other by saying, "Shabbat Shalom". This means good or peaceful sabbath. The proper response to repeat back is "Shabbat Shalom". One does not need to be Jewish to say this.</p>
                <p><b>Kippah:</b> A kippah (or in Yiddish, yarmulke) is a head covering traditionally worn by males during the service and also by females in more liberal synagogues. Wearing a kippah is not a symbol of religious identification like the tallit, but is rather an act of respect to God and the sacredness of the worship space. At Kol Dorot, you may see men and women wearing a kippah. My family will be providing kippot (plural of kippah) with my name and the date. You may keep and wear them.</p>
                <p><b>Tallit:</b> The tallit, or prayer shawl, is traditionally worn by Jewish men and in some liberal congregations, by Jewish women. Because the braided fringes at the four corners (called, tzitzit) remind its wearer to observe the commandments of Judaism, wearing a tallit is reserved for Jews. Although an usher may offer you a tallit at the door, you may decline it if you are not Jewish or are simply uncomfortable wearing such a garment. At age 13, a Bar Mitzvah will wear a tallis for the first time. At Kol Dorot, it is common for men and women to wear tallit.</p>
                <p><b>Prayer Book:</b> The language of the Jewish prayer book, or siddur, is Hebrew, which is written from right to left. Therefore, our prayer books open from the left. The prayer book includes an English translation, so everyone may follow the services.</p>

            <div class="card-header">Why is There Security at the Entrance to the Temple?</div>
            <div class="card-body">Many Jewish congregations and facilities choose to have security officers at larger events, including Bar Mitzvah services, to help provide an atmosphere of safety.</div>

            <div class="card-body">I will lead the congregation through many of the prayers and I will chant a portion of the Torah for the first time. As part of his months of preparation for this formidable task, I have also prepared a d'var torah (word of torah) for the service, which is like a sermon, based on the text of The Ten Commandments. The prayer books, which open and count from right to left, as that is how Hebrew is read, include each prayer in Hebrew and English, as well as a transliteration of the Hebrew words written in English letters. The service will be approximately two hours long.
